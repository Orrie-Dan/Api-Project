**Challenges I encountered**
While setting up my web-01 & web-02 servers I encoutered some difficulties seeing my app on the browser but it was because I had cloned my Repo on the root instead of the /var/www/html directory which was causing me not to see it.
But with the help of one of my classmate who pointed it out I was able to rectify it.
